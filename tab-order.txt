Tab order
Some elements are implicitly inserted into tab order like native controls ex. input, select, button, These all are implicitly focusable But all elements are not focusable by default.

Tab ordering decided based on the DOM actionable element.

To resolve the tab ordering issue, maybe you need to sort or rearrange the DOM element
